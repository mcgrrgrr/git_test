"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on 
the present moment."

-Buddha

"It stands to reason that anyone who learns to live well will die well. 
The skills are the same: being present in the moment, and humble, and brave,
and keeping a sense of humor."

-Victoria Moran
